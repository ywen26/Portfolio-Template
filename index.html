            <p>
                Welcome to my web page! This is Yuwen and currently I am a boot camp student  
                learning coding skills of full stack development. I am actively seeking career
                opportunities as full stack developer and preparing to apply master degree in the
                fields of web development at the same time. I am going to share all my exciting 
                projects work here and will keep update any time as my work in progress.

                In my spare time, I would like to visit some beautiful views and do photography.I am 
                living in Seattle now and hiking is one of my favorite activities during summer.If I 
                have vacation then I would always enjoy to travel and experience the differentcultures. 
                It's the best way to recharge me with full power before returning to daily work!
